# rp-nano-2

## Version two of [rp-nano](https://github.com/TheTridentGuy/rp-nano), a small rp2040 USB dev board.

The last version of this board used the wrong LDO, and used a 4 layer PCB. This time, I designed it in 2 layers, and swapped the second LED for an RGB LED. Aditionally, it has been downsized, at the cost of now only having 64 Mbits of flash (still double the official RaspberryPi Pico).
