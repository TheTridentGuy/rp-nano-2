0.1 hr(s)

i just looked back at my first journal and realized its pretty unclear, i completely redid the layout, and reoriented every component, the board also got smaller.

# made final changes, and got everything ready for review

I made some final tweaks to the design, checked it on jlcpcb again, put together a bom, exported pcb filles, made a readme, added screenshots, etc....

# checked price on jlcpcb:
0.2 hr(s)

Checked the price on jlcpcb, and if i sacrifice doing a 2mm thick board, i can get the pcbs for ~$95 (shipping was almosat twice the price of the pcbs and assembly)

# finish first version of routing:
1.5 hr(s)

finally finished the routing, its all on two layers now, i think there might be some optimizations i can make, and my power wiring is a little janky, im also gonna see how much it costs

# more routing:
0.5 hr(s)

made solid progress on routing important stuff, now i just gotta do power and ground routing ,and then cleanup all my routing again. im praying jlc doesnt get mad at me for my extremely close components

I cleaned up the project, unrouted everything, switched to two layers, swapped out the faulty LDO, and spent the last two hours laying out and routing.
