i just looked back at my first journal and realized its pretty unclear, i completely redid the layout, and reoriented every component, the board also got smaller.

made final changes, and got everything ready for review

I made some final tweaks to the design, checked it on jlcpcb again, put together a bom, exported pcb filles, made a readme, added screenshots, etc....

checked price on jlcpcb

Checked the price on jlcpcb, and if i sacrifice doing a 2mm thick board, i can get the pcbs for ~$95 (shipping was almosat twice the price of the pcbs and assembly)

working on routing

I cleaned up the project, unrouted everything, switched to two layers, swapped out the faulty LDO, and spent the last two hours laying out and routing.
